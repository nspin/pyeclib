# pyeclib

Python bindings for John Cremona's elliptic curves [library](http://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/~masgaj/mwrank/).

Currently, this library only wraps `mwrank`, which performs 2-descent on elliptic curves over Q to find a Mordell-Weil basis when possible.

## Example

```python
import eclib

curve = ((-20, 9), (236, 81), (-1064, 729), (8092, 6561), (0, 1))

eclib.mwrank(curve) # => (((53, 81), (289, 81)),)
```

So the curve
```
$$ C : y^2-\frac{20}{9}xy - \frac{1064}{729}y = x^3 + \frac{236}{81}x^2 + \frac{8092}{6561}x $$
```
has rank 1, and its points of infinite order are generated by `$ \{ (\frac{53}{81}, \frac{289}{81}) \} $`.
